# 🧩 AI Puzzle Solver 🤖

Welcome to the **AI Puzzle Solver**! 🚀 This project leverages artificial intelligence to solve puzzles like Sudoku, sliding tile puzzles, or logic-based challenges using **Java**. By employing algorithms such as A* search, breadth-first search (BFS), or constraint satisfaction, this system delivers efficient and accurate solutions to complex puzzles. 🌟

## 🌟 Overview

Puzzles are a fantastic way to test problem-solving skills, and AI can elevate the experience! This Java-based project implements intelligent algorithms to solve various puzzles, focusing on search strategies and constraint satisfaction. It complements the author's previous work, such as the [Hybrid Movie Recommendation System](https://github.com/Mohamed-Teba/Hybrid_Movie_Recommendation_System), by showcasing AI’s versatility in structured problem-solving. 🧠
